# React Concepts Used

## 1. Components
- **Functional Components:** Most modern React code uses functional components, which are simpler and allow for hooks.

## 2. JSX (JavaScript XML)
- JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript, which React transforms into `React.createElement()` calls.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Using `{ condition ? <Component /> : null }`.
- **Looping over data with `map()`** to render lists of components.

## 3. Props (Properties)
- Passing data from a parent component to a child component via props.
- **Destructuring props** for cleaner code.

## 4. State Management
- Using the `useState` hook to manage component state.
- Initializing state and updating it based on user actions or API responses.

## 5. Hooks
- `useState:` For managing component-level state.
- `useEffect:` For handling side effects like data fetching, DOM updates, and timers.
- `useContext:` For global state management across components using React Context API.

## 6. Event Handling
- Handling user interactions like button clicks and form submissions.
- Using event handler functions, often inline, or defined in the component.

## 7. Conditional Rendering
- Displaying different content based on conditions using ternary operators or `&&` conditions.
- Showing or hiding elements based on state values.

## 8. Lists and Keys
- Rendering lists using `Array.map()`.
- Adding unique `key` props to items in a list to ensure stable identity across renders.

## 9. Forms and Controlled Components
- Managing form data with controlled components (inputs with `value` and `onChange`).
- Handling form submission with `onSubmit` event.

## 10. React Router (for Routing)
- Setting up routes using `react-router-dom` to navigate between pages.
- Using `useNavigate` to programmatically navigate within the app.

## 11. Context API for Global State
- Creating a context with `React.createContext()`.
- Providing context at a higher level to share state across multiple components.

## 12. Ref (for Direct DOM Manipulation)
- Using `useRef` to access or manipulate DOM elements directly, such as focusing an input.

## 13. Component Lifecycle
- Managing component lifecycle behavior using hooks like `useEffect` for mounting, updating, and cleanup.
- Understanding dependency arrays to control when `useEffect` triggers.

## 14. Error Handling and Boundary
- Catching errors in components and using **Error Boundaries** to handle unexpected errors gracefully.

## 15. Custom Hooks
- Creating custom hooks for reusing logic across components (e.g., `useFetch`, `useLocalStorage`).

## 16. Conditional CSS Classes and Styling
- Dynamically applying classes based on state (e.g., `className={isActive ? 'active' : ''}`).
- Using inline styles and CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Styled Components.

## Data Management

In **Gadget Heaven Accessories**, we manage data using a combination of **Local Storage** and **React Context API**. These two methods ensure that product data is retained across sessions and can be accessed and updated across multiple components.

### 1. Local Storage

**Local Storage** is used to persist product data across sessions. When a user adds products to their cart, their selections are stored in the browserâ€™s local storage. This ensures that the userâ€™s cart data is retained even when they refresh the page or navigate to other parts of the application.

#### Storing Data:
We store the data in **Local Storage** using `localStorage.setItem()`. The product data is converted into a JSON format using `JSON.stringify()` before saving.

### 2. React Context API

For **global state management** and sharing data across multiple components, we use the **React Context API**. It allows us to create a central store of data, making it accessible to all components without needing to pass props down through every level of the component tree.

#### Creating Context:
A **context** is created using `React.createContext()`. This provides a way to store and manage shared data across the entire component tree.

## Features

 **Dynamic Cart with Persistent Storage**
   - Users can add products to their cart, and the cart data is stored in local storage. This ensures cart persistence across sessions, even if users refresh or leave the page.

 **Global State Management with Context API**
   - Using the React Context API, the application efficiently shares data across multiple components. This eliminates the need for prop-drilling, making state management cleaner and more efficient.

 **Product Sorting and Filtering**
   - Users can sort products by attributes like price and category, making it easy to find specific items. Filter options help narrow down choices based on user preferences.

**Responsive and Modern UI**
   - Built with Tailwind CSS, the UI is optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop. The clean design enhances user experience and accessibility.

**Interactive Modal for Purchase Confirmation**
   - The modal provides a smooth user experience for checkout and confirmation, allowing users to review items before finalizing purchases.
